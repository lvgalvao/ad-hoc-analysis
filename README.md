# This directory aims to show ad hoc analysis using different technologies, but first, what is ad hoc analysis?
Ad hoc analysis is a business intelligence process designed to answer a specific business question by using company data from various sources. A report helps stakeholders assess an event and formulate actionable next steps.

With ad hoc analysis, users can extract the insight they need to make better business decisions without having to involve the IT department. Typically, an ad hoc report is more visual than a standard data report, making it easy for a non-technical audience to understand and utilize.

# What are the benefits of ad hoc analysis? 
Ad hoc analysis is performed by business users on an as-needed basis to address data analysis needs not met by the business's static, regular reporting. The benefits of self-service BI conducted by ad hoc analysis tools include the following:

## 1. Customizability
Ad hoc analysis tools provide enterprise data analytics across the organization, supporting a variety of niche business needs, and feature customizable reports to meet the specific needs of users.

Many BI solutions also provide templates for easier adoption, limiting data intake to only what is needed. For more advanced users, SQL queries enable a more granular experience, selecting specific business data for reports.

## 2. Ease of use
Most data exploration BI tools are user-friendly and are built with the non-technical user in mind. The interfaces and dashboards are intuitive and simplify data analysis through a single-use report.

## 3. Reduces the IT workload
Ad hoc reporting tools for self-service business intelligence allow users to create timely and tailored reports. This speeds up decision-making and response times to business queries.

## 4. Saves time and financial resources
The intuitive functionality of ad hoc analysis tools eliminates the need for developers to help with queries and create reports. This saves the business money and allows IT teams to focus on other tasks.
